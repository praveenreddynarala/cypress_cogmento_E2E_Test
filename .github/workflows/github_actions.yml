# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, cucumber ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master, cucumber ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "cypress-run"
  cypress-run:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Setup npm package
        run: npm init -y && npm install
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Install NPM dependencies, cache them correctly
      # and run all Cypress tests
      - name: Cypress run
        run: cypress-io/github-action@v2
